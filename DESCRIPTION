Maintainer: Yazmin González <ybgm@outlook.com>
Description: This is an R package to do point estimates and confidence 
    intervals of age-specific fertility rates by single years of age and grouped year of age,
    and total fertility rates, for annual or three-year periods that fall 
    within five years prior to the date of survey. In addition, point estimates 
    of the aforementioned fertility measures for the last fifteen-year prior to the survey. 
    The fertilityRates package uses Tom A Moultrie's methodology "Direct estimation of fertility 
    from survey data containing birth histories." in Tools for Demographic Estimation.
